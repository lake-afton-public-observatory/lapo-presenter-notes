# Lake Afton Public Observatory Presenter Notes
This project uses [MKDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to create web pages providing notes of the objects and programs used at the telescope during the public programs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [Build and Deployment](#build-and-deployment) below for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Build Environment
This project was built using the following environment components:

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

[Python 3.6.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Project Setup
The following are the steps I used to create the fresh Presenter Notes project, 
and these notes can be used for creating a fresh, brand-new MkDocs project.
However, if you are just cloning the existing Presenter Notes project from GitHub, then you can skip these steps and go directly to [Clone this Project](#clone-this-project)
 	
### Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment for the Presenter Notes Project.  
Begin by creating a directory for the Python virtual environment;

Example... from within your lake-afton-presenter-notes project folder
```
virtualenv venv
```

#### Activate the virtual environment:

You can do this from any folder location, recommend from your local github\lake-afton-presenter-notes project folder
```
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

## Prerequisites

See the pip-dependencies.txt file for the Python package requirements for the LAPO Presenter Notes:

### Install Python Packages

**Short-cut**: to install *ALL* pip dependencies:
The following *must* be done from your local github\lake-afton-presenter-notes project folder, where the pip-dependencies.txt exists...

```python
pip install -r pip-dependencies.txt
```

... for manual installation ... do the following...

From your project folder, PIP install MKDocs:

```python
pip install mkdocs
```
reference [MKDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) for more information 

Theme 
This project uses the MkDocs Bootswatch Theme: [Cyborg](http://mkdocs.github.io/mkdocs-bootswatch/#cyborg)

```python
pip install mkdocs-bootswatch
```

### Distance Data

Javascripts have been added to the project, see docs\js\utils.js and docs\init\initialize-json.py, both of these work to create and update ***current*** distance information for each object within the Solar System on pages for each Solar System object. Once the site is up, visit [The Moon > Overview](http://localhost:8000/solar-system/moon/) for example.

Before starting up the MKDocs server, initialize the Distance Data file with the following command:
```python
python ../docs/init/initialize_json.py
```

### Start MkDocs Server - for local testing
To start the MKDocs dev server for testing.
From the presenterNotes folder, execute the following command

	mkdocs serve

You can then open the local site for testing:<br/>
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/
	
## Clone this Project

From the GitHub repository: https://github.com/caketron/lake-afton-presenter-notes
select Clone and copy the URL to the repo: https://github.com/caketron/lake-afton-presenter-notes.git

Then from your local project folder (I am using c:\git\github), execute the following git command:
```git
git clone https://github.com/caketron/lake-afton-presenter-notes
```

## Build and Deployment
Once all editing has been completed, do a final build of the document site for deployment

```
mkdocs build
```

This command will generate the various pages from the markdown files and place them in the "site" sub-directory.

You can use the Python Simple HTTP server that comes with Python to start up a local server.
Change directory into the Site folder and execute the following:

```
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then visit the site by visiting the following address in your browser:

[http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)

## Simplified Deployment

Once the build has completed, a **Site** folder will be found in your project repo folder.

Copy the venv folder and contents of the resources folder into this new **Site** folder.

This **Site** folder now contains the resources for a static website deployment.  Copy the contents to a destination server and execute the startExplainerNotes.bat for the target browser to host the notes locally, e.g., ... the observatory telescope computer.

## Versioning
For the sake of tracking version history, the version numbering will follow a year, month, date numbering sequence, following by a sequence id to account for multiple versions within a single date, in the following format:

	yyyy.MM.dd.#
	e.g.,...  2017.05.02.0

Use this versioning strategy when applying label to the source.

## Contributing
Please follow these simple rules when contributing additional content or changes to the notes:

1. Add a note referencing the source of the material that is being added or changed.

1. Please follow the same formatting, and yes, although a bit tedious, cookie crumb heading and footing references.
