## About these notes...
In an effort to make Observatory Presenter notes more accessible, I have taken the notes left behind by WSU staff and I am using MkDocs (Markdown) to create web-based versions.  The project is in GitHub and I have set up hooks to trigger build/deploy using ReadtheDocs.org ... check out the progress here:  <http://lake-afton-presenter-notes.readthedocs.io/en/latest>.  

I have a theme I am testing locally that converts the pages into nightvision (red text on black) so that  we can serve them up directly in the observing room at LAPO ... also, if you have any content suggestions or feedback I would really appreciate it!!
