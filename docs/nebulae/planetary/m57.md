WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 26mm or 40 mm.

2.	This object will look like a faint whitish, hazy smoke ring when seen through the telescope.


RING NEBULA INFORMATION:

1.	The Ring Nebula was the second planetary ever discovered.  Antoine Darquier discovered it in 1779.

2.	We are looking at the nebula from the “end,” like looking through a barrel.  If we viewed this nebula from a different angle, say from the “side,” it would probably look more like the Dumbbell Nebula.

3.	This nebula is expanding at about 16 miles per second (25 kilometers per second).

tweaked a bit

Magnitude	
01-09-2003	
previously: 9.3 – BUT brighter visually than photographically: see general info page and http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html   
     For magnitude, see  http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m057.html

Distance	
01-09-2003	
previously 4,100 ly – BUT different at http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m057.html – new CCD technique measured trig parallax for central star

Diameter	
01-09-2003	
previously said 0.5 ly – BUT closer to 1 http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m057.html

Actual Brightness – Star	
01-09-2003	
probably close enough
