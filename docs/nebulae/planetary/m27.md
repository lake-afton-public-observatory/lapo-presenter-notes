WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 26mm or 40 mm.

2.	This object will look like a whitish, hazy cloud when seen through the telescope..


DUMBBELL NEBULA INFORMATION:

   
1.	The nebula is expanding at 17 miles per second.
   
2.	The central star’s temperature of 85,000 K, makes it one of the hottest stars known.
   
3.	Discovered on July 12, 1764 by Charles Messier, the Dumbbell Nebula was the first planetary nebula ever discovered.


 


FOR GREG:
See “Other Information” number 2.  I can’t find any info about the central star.

Other Information

      1.   previous, had info: “This planetary’s age of 48,000 years makes it about 2.5 times older than the average age (20,000 years) of typical bright planetary nebulae.”  – BUT all found info says age only 3-4000 years
     2.   previous, had info: “The central star may be a double star with a separation of 1.6 trillion miles (.28 light years or 18,000 times the Earth-sun distance).”  – BUT can only find that “it probably has a faint (mag 27) yellow companion at 6.5" in position angle214 deg (Burnham).” on the SEDS site
