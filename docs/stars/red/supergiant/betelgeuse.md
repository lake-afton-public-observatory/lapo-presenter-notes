#### What To Look For Through The Telescope
---

1.  Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

1.  When people look through the telescope a bright reddish-orange point of light should be seen.

---
## Betelgeuse Information:
---

1.  Betelgeuse is the 7th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (9th brightest if including the Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).
   
1.  An irregularly pulsating red supergiant – its diameter may vary as much as 60% during the whole cycle.

1.  Note the size of this star: if Betelgeuse were placed in our solar system at our sun’s position, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and maybe even Jupiter would be inside Betelgeuse!

1.  This is the biggest star seen from Earth, and probably one of the biggest anywhere.
