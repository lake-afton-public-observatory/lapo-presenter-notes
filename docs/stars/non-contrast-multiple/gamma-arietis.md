#### What To Look For Through The Telescope
---

1.  Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40mm

1.  When people look through the telescope they should see two stars next to each other.  In this case the two stars should be about the same brightness.

## Gamma Arietis Information: 
---

1.  A double star is simply two stars that revolve around each other much like the Earth orbits the sun. 

1.  Over half of the stars in the sky are double or multiple star systems.  They can't be seen as individual stars because they are too far away and too close together.  A good analogy is the headlights of a distant car. 

1.  At least one multiple star system has as many as 9 components. 

1.  Note that the sun is just an ordinary star. 

1.  The stars have not shown a change in position angle in 300 years.
