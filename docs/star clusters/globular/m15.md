WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope the cluster will appear similar to a pile of sugar or salt on a table.


M 15 INFORMATION:

1.	This cluster has a slightly elliptical shape.
   
2.	Although it cannot be seen through the telescope, the northwestern portion of the cluster still has a portion of diffuse nebula.

3.	This cluster is approaching us at about 112 km/sec (70 mi/sec).

4.	The core of M15 is very dense.  It is not certain whether or not there is a black hole at the center of the cluster.
   
 
5.	The first planetary nebula discovered in a globular cluster was found in M15.  (Only three more planetary nebulae have been found in other clusters.)

6.	There are several pulsars in M15.
