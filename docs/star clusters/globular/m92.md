WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope the cluster will appear similar to a pile of sugar or salt on a table.


M 92 INFORMATION:

1.	This cluster is approaching us with a velocity of 112 kilometers per second (70 miles per second).

2.	Trivia: thank to the precession of Earth’s axis, Earth’s North Celestial Pole occasionally passes closer than 1 degree of this cluster.  M92 becomes Earth’s “North Cluster” in about 14,000 years (16,000 A.D.) as it was about 12,000 years ago (10,000 B.C.).
